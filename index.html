							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p> - I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, programming,  User Interface, and mostly the designing part of IT. I am quite interested on how technology will always be a part of today’s reality and would continually evolve every year and it is somewhat amazing to be a part of this industry whom will help cultivate the world into a better and efficient way of living. My interest in IT started when I chose to do computing in year 10 and continued till year 12, the topics were very interesting and came naturally to me. My mother actually studied computer science during her college days and is now working as a business analyst in Telstra. She was the one who introduced me to IT but at first I wasn’t too keen about the field but eventually found it interesting when I gave it a try. I only had one IT experience which was a work experience in TATA consultancy during my year 11 where we had to work with other group of girls who are also interested in IT. There was a project in the end where we were in groups where we had to pitch in ideas on how to further enhance the website of AGL and fortunately, my group won. I’ve chosen to go to RMIT because I’ve heard from friends that RMIT is the place to be for IT and would give me great opportunities and experiences that I need for future use. During my 3 year course, I hope to learn as much information and skills to be able to achieve my future job which would able me to reach my goal to become a UI Designer.</p>

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<p>these results does not surprise me as I know who I really am, what my personality, and what my best learning style suit me best. But there are also some aspects that were eye opening and helped me understand myself even more. The results mostly said that I’m an introvert which is not a good trait to have when working in a team, with this in thought I would try my best to be more engage in a group. These results shows me that I should be less of an introvert if I want to form a team so that I would be involved and engaged in the team by contributing to it.

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							<p>My project idea is a fashion combination application which will help indecisive users to pick which clothing suits the best for the day. This will minimise the time allocated to try on different clothes which will take so much time and would make them late. This would be suitable for all ages and for every gender. This app would be a clothing generator that will be holding data about the user’s clothing and would able them to see different types of clothing that they own and see if each pieces match. This app would be useful because most people in the world especially women have the problem of picking which outfit to wear each day and would often cause problems to their relationships or work as they would be late. This would help women especially as they do more rituals than men as they have to shower, makeup and picking the outfit all in one. There was a poll made my marks and Spencer that the average women spends 17 minutes of picking what outfit to wear. This app would be able to solve that problem for every women or anyone. This would help organise and manage the user’s time and would be able to have more time in their hands to do other activities. The app would have unlimited data storage to store all the images of the user’s different types of clothing. The app will have a next and previous button for every type of clothing to mix and match the outfits. It would also be able to suggest which outfit would best suit the day of the user. It would also have a section in which for different events, theres an allocated outfit. It would also have a section where user can customise whether they want the clothes to be categorised into colours, seasons, or type of clothing. This app would also be able to set a specific clothing for each day which will be done by the user beforehand. A software that will be appropriate to make this app would be appery.io and apple pie. appery.io would be best for designing the User Interface of the app which would be great because having an attractive user interface would get user’s attention. On the other hand, the software apple pie is for the coding part of the application. The skills that are required for the making of this application is an eye for design. The design of the application should be presentable and attractive to be able to grab people’s attention. A skill in html and coding is much needed to make this application to add the features of the application and function as it should be. 
If the project is successful, it would be a great help to everybody who are having problems in coming up with outfits they would want to wear everyday. It will be a big hit for women especially as they don’t have to try every clothes which would waste a lot of time when they can just use the app which would be easy and efficient. Women would be able to have more time in prepping themselves with their outfits out their mind and they would be at ease.
